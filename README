amb4live is a method for using Ableton Live to sequence the parameters to the ICST Max/MSP Ambisonics encoder (icst.net/research/downloads/ambisonics-externals-for-maxmsp).  a Max4Live audio effect defines azimuth, elevation, and distance parameter knobs and sends these values every 50 ms via osc-over-udp to a Max/MSP patch that routes the parameters to the ICST encoder.  

The project consists of three files: 
    1) the Max4Live patch (ambisonic.amxd), which contains the Live GUI objects, the JS object, and the OSC object used for formatting the parameters (azimuth, elevation, etc.) before they are sent over UDP to the Ambisonics encoder in the external Max/MSP "monitor" patch
    2) the javascript file (source.js) used by the JS object within the Max4Live effect to manage the effect's state, detect events (parameter updates, change in 'Ext. Out' channel number) through the LiveAPI object, and generate the Ambisonics encoder parameters accordingly	 	 
    3) an example external Max/MSP "monitor" patch, which receives the Ext. Out audio channels from Live (via Jack audio server, Soundflower, etc.), individually encodes them using the Ambisonics encoder (which is parameterized by the data received in OSC in UDP from the Max4Live patch), and then decodes them according to the speaker arrangement specified by the Ambisonics monitor object (ambimonitor).  alternatively, the encoder can be directly connected to the Max ~dac, and a different Ambisonics decoder implementation, such as <insert link to AmbDec>, may be connected to Max via Jack.
